# crud-lang

_This is now in first-draft phase. Meaning, I just had the idea and I am jotting down very preliminary design decisions._

    * an experimental language for CRUD applications (backend only though)
    * Enterprise as a first-class citizen
    * urls are made up directories and filenames
    * a controller sourcefile is a file with the .ctl extension
    * likewise
    	* .svc services
    	* .cl service clients (that call other services)
    	* .dao database access code (not objects)
    	* .qc queueconsumers
    	* .qp queueproducers
    	* .utl utilities
    * there is a strict calling hierarchy. A service can not call a controller. It can only go 'down'.
    * Services can not call other services, because that is the recipe for spaghetti. Refactor your logic, abstract and put lower level code in utilities.
    * Utilities are allowed to call other utilities. OMG, spaghetti after all! TBD

    * It is an interpreter written in rust. OMG!
    * And it has everything I like in other languages
    	* strictly typed
    	* [] is a list
    	* {} is a map
    	* no objects, no inheritance
    	* structs and duck typing
    	* everything is an expression
    	* nice iterators.
    	* First class functions? Maybe...

**types**

- u32, i32
- u64, i64
- f32, f64,
- string, bool, char
- struct enum

**question**

- how to model headers
- middleware, implement later

**the example: **

- a very simple api that listens to GET /api/customers{:id} and returns a customer from the database
