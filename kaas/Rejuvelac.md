Finally got round to making gluten-free rejuvelac from buckwheat grains (not kasha that won’t sprout)

1. soak them for a couple of hours
2. Rinse
3. Put them in a sieve/colander/sprouting tray from fine mesh 
4. Put that in a bowl
5. Pour in water so that the seeds remain above the water line
6. Cover
7. Put away for 2 to 3 days.
8. Refresh the water and rinse twice per day
9. Small whitish sprouts will appear

At least that’s where I’m now. 
It’s in a clean jar covered with water and it should start fermenting
