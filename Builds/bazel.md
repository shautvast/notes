**Bazel** 

Suited for monorepo’s
Steep learning curve
You have to do it the google way, or else you are stupid
‘Bazel is some people trying to get promoted at Google’

Does not integrate well with 
* JavaScript projects 
* IntelliJ  adjust build files after refactoring 
Fair maintenance cost
Multi language but not out of the box
Bumpy roads while migrating


**Earthly**
- Commercial
- Wrapper around lang specific build tool like gradle
