No problem! We can make the apple pie vegan by substituting the egg and butter while still keeping it moist and delicious. Here’s the updated recipe with vegan alternatives.

### **Vegan and Gluten-Free Apple Pie Recipe**

#### **Ingredients:**

##### For the Vegan Gluten-Free Pie Crust:
- 2 ½ cups gluten-free all-purpose flour blend (ensure it contains xanthan gum, or add 1 tsp separately)
- 1 tsp xanthan gum (omit if your flour blend already contains it)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- ½ tsp salt
- 1 cup cold vegan butter or coconut oil (solid, not melted)
- 1 tbsp apple cider vinegar
- 6-8 tbsp ice water

##### For the Apple Filling:
- 6-7 medium apples (Granny Smith or Honeycrisp), peeled, cored, and thinly sliced
- 2/3 cup sugar (you can use part maple syrup for added moisture)
- 1/4 cup brown sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1/4 tsp nutmeg
- 1 tbsp lemon juice
- 2 tbsp cornstarch or arrowroot powder (for thickening)
- 2 tbsp vegan butter or margarine (optional for added richness)
- 2 tbsp maple syrup (or agave syrup for a lighter sweetness)

#### **Instructions:**

##### **For the Vegan Gluten-Free Pie Crust**:
1. **Combine Dry Ingredients**: In a large bowl, whisk together the gluten-free flour, sugar, salt, and xanthan gum (if using separately).
2. **Cut in the Vegan Butter**: Add the cold vegan butter (or coconut oil) and cut it into the dry ingredients using a pastry cutter or your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs with pea-sized pieces of butter throughout.
3. **Substitute for Egg**: Instead of using an egg, add 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed mixed with 3 tablespoons of water (this is a flax egg). Let it sit for 5 minutes to thicken.
4. **Add Apple Cider Vinegar**: Add the apple cider vinegar to the flax egg and mix into the flour-butter mixture.
5. **Add Ice Water**: Gradually add ice water, 1 tablespoon at a time, mixing until the dough starts to come together. You want it to be moist but not sticky. You may not need all the water.
6. **Chill the Dough**: Divide the dough in half, shape each half into a disk, and wrap in plastic wrap. Refrigerate for at least 1 hour (or up to 2 days).

##### **For the Apple Filling**:
1. **Prepare the Apples**: In a large bowl, toss the sliced apples with lemon juice to prevent browning.
2. **Mix the Filling**: In a small bowl, mix together the sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, nutmeg, and cornstarch (or arrowroot). Pour this mixture over the apples and toss to coat evenly.
3. **Add Moisture-Retaining Ingredients**: Drizzle the maple syrup over the apples and toss again.

##### **Assemble the Pie**:
1. **Roll Out the Crust**: On a lightly floured surface (use gluten-free flour), roll out one disk of dough to fit a 9-inch pie pan. Gently transfer the dough to the pan, pressing it into the edges.
2. **Add the Apple Filling**: Pour the apple filling into the pie shell, spreading it out evenly. Dot with vegan butter if using.
3. **Top the Pie**: Roll out the second disk of dough and carefully place it over the apples. Trim any excess dough and crimp the edges to seal the pie. Cut a few small slits in the top crust to allow steam to escape.

##### **Bake**:
1. **Preheat the Oven**: Preheat your oven to 400°F (200°C).
2. **Bake the Pie**: Place the pie on a baking sheet to catch any drips. Bake for 20 minutes at 400°F, then reduce the temperature to 350°F (175°C) and continue baking for 35-40 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the filling is bubbling.
3. **Cool**: Let the pie cool for at least 2 hours before slicing.

#### **Vegan Egg Wash (Optional)**:
- To create a golden finish without using eggs, brush the top crust with a mixture of 2 tbsp plant-based milk (like almond or oat milk) and 1 tsp maple syrup before baking.

#### **Storage and Reheating**:
- **Store** the pie covered in plastic wrap or in an airtight container to keep it from drying out.
- **Reheat** slices in a low oven (around 300°F) to maintain a crisp crust without sogginess.

This version is entirely vegan and gluten-free, and the use of maple syrup, vegan butter, and the flax egg ensures a moist, tender pie with plenty of flavor and richness!
